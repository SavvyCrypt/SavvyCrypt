- 👋 Hello, welcome to my github profile. I am @SavvyCrypt.
- 👀 I am interested in crypto currency, decentralization, and freedom.  Decentralized finance offers true freedom and I plan on contributing to this space as much as I can.  I have experience in the IT industry, but I am new to the blockchain space.

- 🌱 I am currently learning RUST and smart contract concepts.

- 💞️ I am looking to collaborate in the blockchain space and help contribute.

- 📫 You can reach me via savvycrypt@protonmail.com and SavvyCrypt#5124 on Discord.

Thank You for visiting!
